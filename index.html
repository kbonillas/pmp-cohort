            <p class="intro">Interface and experience go hand-in-hand when using an application. Designing with the interface and experience in mind will create the best possible outcome for the user. Without it, there isn’t really any thought in who you want using your application.</p> <!-- row 5 -->

                <p class="side-info1">User Experience (UX) Design and User Interface (UI) Design work flawlessly together to make the best possible application. The roles are different because they each deal with a different process.</p>
                <p class="side-info2">UX looks at how the application works and how the user is experiencing the application. UI looks at the overall design on how everything is put together, and it is what the user first sees when they use the application.</p>

            <h1 class="sub1">What is<br><span class="yellow">UX</span> / <span class="yellow">UI</span>?</h1> <!-- row 10 -->
            <p class="ux-ui-content">UX has the main process of making the experience that the user has the best experience ever. It focuses on how easy the application is to use, if the user enjoys the application, as well as continuous testing to see if anything can be improved in the design. UX focuses on the overall interactions between users as well as potential users. UI takes on the look and feel of the overall application. The interface is the more visual portion of the design. Emil Lamprecht explains the difference of UX and UI in more detail <a class="blue-link" href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/the-difference-between-ux-and-ui-design-a-laymans-guide/">in his post here.</a></p> <!-- row 11 -->
            
            <div class="blue2"> <!-- row 12 & 13 -->
                <p class="side-info3">UX uses wireframes and prototypes before any other design is put into it, to make sure the functionality works first. Testing is also incorporated so the creators can plan and easily make revisions without having to touch any code. Designers and developers should be taking mobile design into great consideration these days, according to <a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/Number-of-Mobile-Only-Internet-Users-Now-Exceeds-Desktop-Only-in-the-U.S">Comscore in a post from 2015.</a> <br>More users are looking at websites off their mobile devices since they are always on the go. Tablets/mobile phones are becoming more popular and it’s usually easier to whip out a smaller device than trying to find a laptop to find information.</p>

            <h1 class="sub2"><span class="yellow">UX</span> / <span class="yellow">UI</span><br>for Law</h1> <!-- row 15 -->
            <p class="ux-ui-law">The designer/developer should always be thinking about who the user is. What is the user most likely looking for when they are going to your website? Make sure that you are hitting these areas on the website and that they are easy to find. It’s better to make something easy to find rather than having the user search throughout the whole website to find one thing. Then again, the website should have an interface that isn’t complex and hard to navigate. If your company would like to know the type of design a law firm tends to have, Jaime Morrison compiled <a class="blue-link" href="https://whatpixel.com/law-firm-web-design/">a list of company websites</a> that could bring creative inspiration.</p> <!-- row 16 -->

            <div class="blue3"> <!-- row 17 & 18 -->
                <p class="side-info4">Usually contact information is the first thing that users look for in order to find out more information about your company. There should be either a contact button in the navigation, or contact info readily available on each page, either in the header or footer.</p>
                <p class="side-info5">Morrison also explains that the best website will work in design and content. The website must be functional in a way that any person can use it, regardless if they have used a law firm website before. The designer/developer needs to find a great way to easily display the information that the client will be looking for.</p>

            <h3 class="good-design">Good Design</h3> <!-- row 21 -->
            <p class="good-info">UI design should be error-free, easy to use, easy to understand, and be effective for the product. The end goal is to leave a good feeling with the user to make them feel as if they had accomplished something by visiting your application. The same goes for the UX of the application. There is little difficulty in completing the desired tasks when visiting the website. They are also able to complete said tasks in a timely manner. Good UI/UX includes good typography, readability, structured navigation system and content, graphics/text work well together, etc.<br><em>“Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible.” - Don Norman</em></p> <!-- row 22 -->

            <h3 class="bad-design">Bad Design</h3> <!-- row 31 -->
            <p class="bad-info">There isn’t enough contrast within the website. It’s hard to determine what the user should be interacting with. It also isn’t responsive. If the user has looked at your website on a desktop, and then goes to show someone else on their mobile device, they find out that they have to zoom in on the screen and the buttons are harder to interact with because it was not designed for mobile. Also, the navigation menu is not structured to where the user can’t find what they are looking for. The user is spending more time trying to find what they’re looking for rather than reading the relevant information that they came to your website for. Lastly, the various pages aren’t consistent in style. One page has the menu at the top and then the next page has the menu on the bottom. All the pages should have the same template but only the body style can vary.</p> <!-- row 32 -->
